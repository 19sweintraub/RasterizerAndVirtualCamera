1.) Case 1: The intersection point lines outside of the triangle. If so, use the closest triangle edge point.
Case 2: Slope of the triangle edge is 0. If so, ignore this edge.
Case 3: Slope of the triangle edge is undefined. If so, use the X coordinate of either point.

2.) The barycenter of a triangle forms 3 sub-triangles between the barycenter and the vertices of the triangle. If any of the sub-triangles have an area
greater than the mian triangle, then the bary center is outside of the triangle. This method would be less efficient than row bound checking. For each pixel in the triangle, 
you would need to calculate the areas of the 3 sub triangles to make a determination. With row bound, once the L and R bounds are detected, you only have to check to see if each
pixels x coordinate is within the range for a given row. This is more efficient.

3.) 

Step 1: Convert World-Space coordinates to Camera-Space coordinates via the View-Matrix which is composed of the rotation and translation of the camera axis relative to the world coordinate system.
Step 2: Convert Camera coordiantes to Unhomogenized Screen Space via Projection Matrix. The projection matrix scalex X,Y to [-1, 1] using the field of view. Z is scaled from 0 to 1 between clipping planes.
Step 3: Convert Unhomogenized Screen Space Coordinates to Screen Space Coordiantes by dividing by W. This performs perspective divide.
Step 4: Convert from screen space to Pixel Space by scaling the NDC to the corresponding screen's pixel location.
